Instructions: Welcome to my Stock App, a web application that allows you to build a portfolio and view transactions. 

Instructions for use:

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. In your terminal, within the directory you saved it in, enter: cd stock-port/stock-api
3. Enter: atom . or your code editor of choice
You are now in the rails API file
4. Here in your terminal, because this is running on Postgres, you need to run rails db:create and then rails db:migrate
5. Run rails s -p 3001 to start the server (this will run the api on localhost:3001)
6. Toggle to the frontend code by typing cd  and then cd stock-port-react/stock-react
7. Run yarn install then yarn start (this will run on localhost:3000) 

Thank you for checking out my project! Have fun!
